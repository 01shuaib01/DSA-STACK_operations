# DSA-STACK_operations

Introduction to Stack in Data Structures
The stack is a linear data structure. Operations on Stack are performed in LIFO (Last In First Out) order.

Applications of Stack

Used in function calls
Infix to postfix conversion (and other similar conversions)
Parenthesis matching and more â€¦
Stack ADT

In order to create a stack, we need a pointer to the topmost element along with other elements that are stored inside the stack.

Some of the operations of the Stack ADT are:

push() : push an element into the stack
pop() : remove the topmost element from the stack


  3. Display : Value at a given position is returned

 4. isEmpty() / isFull() : Determine whether the stack is empty or full

Implementation

A stack is a collection of elements with certain operations following LIFO (Last in First Out) discipline.

A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
